## Guide

If this is your first time using a tracker, don't worry this quick introduction will cover the basics of writing a little track, and exporting it to an audio file. 

The interface is divided into 3 columns, the *sequencer*, the *pattern editor* and the *instrument*. By default, the application launches with an active pattern, in the first instrument. There is a maximum of 16 instruments that can play at the same time. 

To move the **pattern cursor**, use the `arrowUp`, and `arrowDown`, keys. Pressing the keyboard keys a,s,d,f,g,h & j will record a note in the first row of the selected row. Pressing the `ArrowDown` and `ArrowUp` keys, will move the *cursor* up/down in the sequencer. Allowing you to fill `pattern #1` with notes. Pressing `space` will play the pattern, pressing `esc` will stop and pressing `del`/`backspace` will erase a note. By default, a new Marabu track has the pattern #1 loaded into the first instrument.

To change the **sequencer patterns**, use the arrow keys while `holding alt`. To add notes to a second instrument, move to the second column and press `alt ArrowRight`, this will set the first row of the second instrument to 1, and allow you to record notes. Press `alt ArrowDown` to move to the second row, and press `alt ArrowRight` again twice, to extend the track to 2 rows, and begin adding notes to the second row of the second instrument.

To change the **instrument controls**, use the arrow keys while `holding shift`. To save your song, press `ctrl s`, to render an audio file(.wav) press `ctrl r`.
