# Marabu

Marabu is a web based music tracker(sequencer) tool, based on soundbox, under development. It needs to run through localhost, it only works on Chrome. The repository comes with a script that fires Marabu from within Localhost:8033.

```
cd Marabu
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8033
http://localhost:8033/
```

- Copy paste in sequencer when multiple lines are selected, and paste when a cell is empty.
