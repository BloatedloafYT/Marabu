<h1>SoundBox Lite</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SoundBox Lite is a tool for composing synthetic music, in your browser. Its
design is basically that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">music tracker</a>,
which essentially means that the music is organized in <em>tracks</em> and <em>patterns</em>.</p>


<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p>Perhaps the quickest way to get started is to open one of the demo songs and
start playing with it.</p>

<p>Start by pressing the <img src="gui/open.png" alt="Open" /> button, and select
one of the songs. Once it has been opened, press the <img src="gui/play.png" alt="Play" />
button to start the song.</p>

<p class="note">Note: The entire song has to be generated (i.e. synthesized in software)
before it can be played. This can take some time, but on a fast computer it should
not take more than ten seconds or so for normal song.</p>


<h2>The editor</h2>

<p>A song is made up of <strong>8 channels</strong>, where each channel has its
own <strong>instrument</strong>. Each channel has <strong>10 note patterns</strong>
(0-9), and each note pattern has <strong>4 note tracks</strong> and
<strong>1 FX track</strong>.</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="help/ui-overview.png" width=900 height=451 alt="Overview"></img></div>

<h3>1. Import/Export &amp; Playback</h3>

<p>In this section you can import (open) and export (save) songs. Here you can
also play the song (or just a section of the song).</p>

<h3>2. Sequencer</h3>

<p>Each column in the sequencer represents one channel. Selecting a column will
show the instrument settings for the selected channel in the instrument
editor (4).</p>

<p>For each channel, there are 10 available note patterns. By typing a number
(0-9) in a sequencer cell (or by using the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/plus-one.png" alt="+1" />/<img class="smallButton" src="gui/minus-one.png" alt="-1" /> buttons below the sequencer), the corresponding note pattern will be visible and
editable in the pattern editor (3).</p>

<p>It is possible to select a range in the sequencer (by click+dragging), and
then copy the selected range with the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-copy.png" alt="Copy" /> button,
and the copied range can then be pasted to any other position with the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-paste.png" alt="Paste" /> button.</p>

<h3>3. Pattern editor</h3>

<p>The pattern editor consists of four columns, which enables four notes to be
played simultaneously. There is also an effect track (FX track), that can be
used to dynamically control all aspects of an instrument during playback.</p>

<p>To enter notes in the pattern editor, <em>a valid pattern (0-9) must have been
selected in the sequencer</em>. Notes are entered with the piano (5).</p>

<p>Just as with the sequencer, it is possible to copy and paste note data with
the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-copy.png" alt="Copy" /> &amp;
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/edit-paste.png" alt="Paste" /> buttons.
It is also possible to transpose a selected range of notes with the
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/plus-one.png" alt="+1" />,
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/minus-one.png" alt="-1" />,
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/plus-twelve.png" alt="+12" /> and
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/minus-twelve.png" alt="-12" /> buttons.</p>

<h3>4. Instrument editor</h3>

<p>An instrument is synthetically generated using a few simple building blocks,
according to the chart below:</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="help/instrument-graph.png" width=790 height=360 alt="Overview"></img></div>

<p>Each part of the instrument chain is controlled by the instrument settings,
and with careful tuning you can produce many different kinds of sounds.</p>

<p>An easy way to get started with an instrument is to select one of the presets
from the drop-down box, and then change some settings until you get the sound
you are looking for.</p>


<h3>5. Piano</h3>

<p>The piano is used for entering notes into the selected note pattern. Pressing
keys on the piano will produce notes in the pattern.</p>

<p>A more efficient way to enter notes is to use the computer keyboard (if you
have one). The mapping of keyboard keys to piano keys are as follows:</p>

<div class="centered"><img src="help/keyboard-layout.png" width=626 height=204 alt="Keyboard layout"></img></div>

<p>Both the piano and the keyboard only covers two octaves. To reach more
octaves, use the <img class="smallButton" src="gui/button-prev.png" alt="Octave down" /> and
<img class="smallButton" src="gui/button-next.png" alt="Octave up" /> keys
next to the piano to change the base octave for the piano/keyboard.</p>


<h2>Playing music</h2>

<p>A tip: Playing the entire song over and over when editing music can be quite
tiresome. Use the <img src="gui/play-range.png" alt="Play range" /> button to
just play the selected range (e.g. a single pattern). You can also use the
keyboard short-cut: <strong>space</strong>.</p>


<h2>Loading and saving</h2>

<p>Songs are saved as data URLs that you can deal with in pretty much any way
you want. For instance, you can mail the song to a friend, bookmark it in your
browser, put it through an URL shortener and tweet it, or you can copy &amp;
paste it to a local text file if you wish to save it for later.</p>

<p class="note">Note: The entire song is stored in the URL. Nothing is stored in
a file or on a server.</p>


<h2>License</h2>
<p>SoundBox Lite (including the GUI, the instrument presets and demo songs), is
released under the GNU General Public License v3.</p>

<p>The player routine (<a href="player.js">player.js</a>), however, is released
under the zlib/libpng license, making it easy to use and adapt the player
routine for your own products (e.g. demos). You'll find that the "Export JS"
function comes in handy if you want to use a song in your own product.</p>

<p>Also, many thanks to Jake Taylor (a.k.a Ferris / Youth Uprising) for the
original C language synth that was the starting point and inspiration for this
tool.</p>
